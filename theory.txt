Execution engine gives us two things 
   1 - Global Object
   2 - this

   this - window (this is browser window)

   Global Object - window

   Hoisting
----------------
When you declare variables and functions in javascript ,
the Execution engine sets up a memory space for variables and
functions .

1.If it is a variable it will keep that variable in memory and assign
a default value called undefined.
2. If it is a function it will copy the entire function and 
keeps in memory. 
   
   undefined
   ---------------
   It is special value in javascript which takes up memory space.

   Warning : Never ever declare a variable undefined, Because it is difficult to \
   find value is 'undefined' because we set it or javascript engine set it up.

Types In Javascript:
----------------------
Dynamic Typing:
----------------
You don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds
It figures out while your code running.

Strict Typing
----------------
C# or java follows script Typing

Prmitive Types
--------------------
A type of data that represents a single value is called primitive data type.

1. undefined - This represents lack of existance(we should never use this).
2. null - This represents lack of existance(we can set a variable to this).
3. Boolean - true or false
4. number - Integer/floating type(decimal)
5. string - it is a sequence of characters
6. symbol - used in ES6

Anything which is not primitive is an object in javascript.

object
function
array
Date
RegularExpression

Functions
--------------
Function is a block of code wrapped around flower brackets and invocated later.

function functionname(){

}

1. Regular Function
2. Anonymous Functions
3. Immediately Invoked Functions(IIFs)
